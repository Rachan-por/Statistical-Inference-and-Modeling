## Homework 1
The exercises of this homework is in Chapter 3 of An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R. Ex.9 will show how to how to perform multiple linear regression, use p-value to tell significant variables to the response, identify the outliers and high leverage points and experiment about interaction effect and some transformation of the variables. Ex.14 colinearity problem, there are 2 highly correlated variables as an input of the model. This excercise will show the result of colinearity problem. Furthermore, It will be used Studentized residual and Hat matrix to identify an outlier and a high leverage point, respectively.
