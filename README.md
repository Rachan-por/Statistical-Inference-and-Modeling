# Statistical-Inference-and-Modeling
This code is all about learning EE2102575 Statistical Interference and Modeling course in the department of electrical engineering Chulalongkorn University. This course taught about Linear/Nonlinear Regression, Reguralization tecniques, Model Selection, Resampling methods, Logistic regression, K-NN, LDA, QDA, Suppoet Vector Machine, Tree-based methods, PCA, K-means, Gaussian Mixture Models, EM-algorithm and Self-organizaing map (SOM).

Reference textbooks of this course are An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R and The Elements of Statistical Learning Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction.

## Chapter_ISLR
This are notebooks which are created for summarizinig (in thai) the ideas and wrote a python code to visuallize the content in the ISLR book. 


## Homework 1
The exercises of this homework are in Chapter 3 of An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R. 
* Ex.9 will show how to how to perform multiple linear regression, use p-value to tell significant variables to the response, identify the outliers and high leverage points and experiment about interaction effect and some transformation of the variables. 
* Ex.14 colinearity problem, there are 2 highly correlated variables as an input of the model. This excercise will show the result of colinearity problem. Furthermore, It will be used Studentized residual and Hat matrix to identify an outlier and a high leverage point, respectively.

## Homework 2
* The first exercise is to discuss the prostate cancer data which is available in the ESL book. The second exercise is to apply robust regression by changing the loss function of linear regression (using l-1 norm and huber loss instead). The last exercise is to estimate ARX models and use model selection score to choose the appropriate order of the model.

## Homework 3
* This homework will illustrate the trade off between model error and \gamma the parameter of regularization term in Ridge and lasso regression and show the solution path of prostate cancer data after performing lasso and ridge regression.

## Homework 4
* This homework is a classification problem and uses the credit card default dataset (Default.csv) which is available in the ISLR book. The models used are Logistic regression, kNN, Naiev Bayes, LDA and QDA and then observe the performance of each method.
